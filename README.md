Lambda NeXt is Lambda School's flagship program to help their students build a fully functional project to showcase their skills. The goal of Lambda NeXt is to build projects that solve a real world problem.

This website was created to help alleviate the pain in choosing which problem to solve by helping source volunteers and research the problem before committing teams to creating a working prototype.

### Key Features

- View list of problems approved by Admins
- Vote on a problem you want featured
- Sign up to help with research for a problem
- Add a problem for Admins to approve

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### _React.js + Redux.js_

Why did we choose React.js + Redux.js?

- React scales nicely for complex projects
- Redux is a great global state management tool
- Easiest to get started with, and familiarity with framework

Libraries

- FontAwesome
- MaterialUI
- Axios
- PropTypes
- React Router
- React Router Hash Link
- Redux Thunk

#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

### [Back end](https://github.com/labs15-lambda-next/backend) built using:

#### Node.js + Express.js + PostgreSQL

Why did we choose Node.js + Express.js + PostgreSQL?

- Based off experience alone and also fits perfectly for the project.
- Easy Scalability
- Express makes it easier by having to write less code vs using only node.
- Clear documentation

Libraries

- SendGrid Email
- JsonWebToken
- Passport
- Helmet
- Cors

#### Back end deployed to `Heroku`

# APIs

### SendGrid Email

- Used to send transactional email

#### _Future work can connect a Lambda School DS project where it automatically generates Problems for administrators to approve._

# Testing

For testing, we mainly used PropType validation, and began testing with Jest.

- PropTypes
  - Used to make sure props were passed down correctly.
- Jest
  - Used to check a few actions.
  - Future work:
    - Currently not all tests are passing
    - Figure out how to mock test reducers
    - Needs more test coverage.

# Future Features + Needs Work

- Transition Class components to use React Hooks for entire site
- Switch Material UI styles to use 'styled' hooks

- Need to increase Performance score in [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) (Chrome DevTools -> Audits)
- Need styling in ProblemSubmissionModal (couldn't figure out how to style Dialog component from Material UI)
- Need to switch Admin Components to Material UI (currently using Styled Components)
- Need to adjust styling for Admin Components to match entire site
- Remove unneccessary files from repository
- Remove unneccessary code from JS files
- Increasing test coverage
- Connect back end with DS project to autopopulate problem dashboard
  - Add some kind of pagination to application when there's too many problems
